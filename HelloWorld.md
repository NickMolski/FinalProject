## Hello World Program!

This program is typically the first program anyone writes when learning a new software, and it's pretty simple!

Let's get started!

1) At the top of the Python Shell, click "File" and click on "New File". An untitled file should pop up. Before we do anything, we need to save the file. In the untitled file, go under "File", then "Save As...". Save the file wherever you would like and name it "HelloWorld".

2) Now that the file is saved, let's start coding! In this tutorial, we are going to have "Hello World!" pop up when we run the program. To do this, we are going to use "print()" Print is basically "printing" whatever is in the parameters (the parenthesis). So, we are going to do this:
<br>
```
print("Hello World!")
```
Make sure to put the quotation marks! If not, it will treat it as a variable (We will get into that in the 2nd program). The quotation marks treat the text inside as a string.

3) And it's as easy as 1, 2, 3! Once you have the above code typed in the file, go to "Run" and then "Run Module". The Python Shell should pop up again and you should see "Hello World!". Easy enough, right? Let's get into something harder, a random number generator! Click below to go back to the README!
