<h2> Welcome to my Python tutorial!
<h4> by Nick Molski


<h5> Summary:
In this tutorial, I will be showing you the very basics of Python! We will first run a "Hello World" program (Which should be the first program you right in any language!) and then a random number generator program.

<h5>Don't have any experience with programming? No problem! This is for anyone that have absolutely no experience with programming, so I'll explain everything!

<h2> First, you need to download Python!
<h5>[Click here to go to the Python website!](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

<h2>Now that we got that out of the way, let's starting coding!
<body>
<h3>Begin by clicking "Hello World" and once your finished with that, go to Random Number Generator!
